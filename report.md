Like other ActivityStreams objects, actors have an id, which is a URI. When entered <br> directly into a user interface (for example on a login form), it is desirable to support simplified naming. For this <br> purpose, ID normalization <mark>SHOULD</mark> be performed as follows: <br>  <br>   1. If the entered ID is a valid URI, then it is to be used directly. <br>   2. If it appears that the user neglected to add a scheme for a URI that would otherwise be considered valid, such as <br>      example.org/alice/, clients MAY attempt to provide a default scheme, preferably https. <br>   3. Otherwise, the entered value should be considered invalid. <br>  |

**Specification:** [7.1.2 - Forwarding from Inbox](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#inbox-forwarding)

> When Activities are received in the inbox, the server needs to forward these to recipients that the origin was unable <br> to deliver them to. To do this, the server MUST target and deliver to the values of to, cc, and/or audience if and <br> only if all of the following are true: <br>  <br>   This is the first time the server has seen this Activity. <br>   The values of to, cc, and/or audience contain a Collection owned by the server. <br>   The values of inReplyTo, object, target and/or tag are objects owned by the server. The server <mark>SHOULD</mark> recurse <br>     through these values to look for linked objects owned by the server, and SHOULD set a maximum limit for recursion <br>     (ie. the point at which the thread is so deep the recipients followers may not mind if they are no longer getting <br>     updates that don't directly involve the recipient). The server MUST only target the values of to, cc, and/or <br>     audience on the original object being forwarded, and not pick up any new addressees whilst recursing through the <br>     linked objects (in case these addressees were purposefully amended by or via the client). <br>  <br> The server MAY filter its delivery targets according to implementation-specific rules (for example, spam filtering). <br>
